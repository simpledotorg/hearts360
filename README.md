## About

This dashboard is a template that can be used by any team working on a hypertension control project. Our team has learned many lessons while developing the [Simple.org](https://simple.org/) project and we want to share our best practices with the world. A similar dashboard has been used in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Ethiopia, and Nigeria to successfully manage over 4 million patients with hypertension.

Please feel free to copy any of the code or ideas that you see in this hypertension dashboard (see [open source license](https://github.com/simpledotorg/hypertension-dashboard#license) open source license below).

## Data & definitions

### Basic Data

A very good public health hypertension dashboard only requires a small number of longitudinal patient data as building blocks:

- `Enrolled patients diagnosed with hypertension` with `Enrollment date` and `Enrollment facility`
- `Patients who had a BP measure in the last 3 months` and was the BP measure ≥140/90 or <140/90?
- `Patients who had a BP measure in the last 12 months`
- `Patient status as living or died`

### Useful Data

Data that shows how much of a region's population has lowered blood pressure is also very helpful. If a region does public health surveys, including the `Estimated population with hypertension` allows you to easily report coverage metrics.

### Inventory data

Adding data on drug stock and functioning BP devices helps round out the dashboard to make it even more useful.

## Developer documentation
