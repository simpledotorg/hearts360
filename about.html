        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          This dashboard is a template that can be used by any team working on a
          hypertension control project. Our team at
          <a href="https://rtsl.org/">Resolve to Save Lives</a> has learned many
          lessons while developing the
          <a href="https://simple.org">Simple.org</a> project and we want to
          share our best practices with the world. A similar dashboard has been
          used in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Ethiopia, and Nigeria to
          successfully manage over 4 million patients with hypertension.
        </p>
