              <p>This indicator is a very simplistic representation of the number of patients controlled. It is primarily useful as a motivational tool for health staff and for advocacy. The data simply represents the numerator from the "BP controlled at latest visit in past 3 months" indicator below.</p>

                <p>By the end of July, 4808 patients had a visit anytime from May 1 to July 31 and at their most recent visit, they had their BP controlled.</p>

        <h2 id="about">About</h2>
        <p>This is a free and open source dashboard that is intended as a template that can be used by any hypertension control program. The code is available for free on <a href="https://github.com/simpledotorg/hypertension-dashboard">Github</a> and is licensed under an MIT License.</p>
        <p>This page details the data required to setup a working version of this <a href="index.html">dashboard</a></p>
        <!--h2 id="background">Background</h2>
        <h3 id="Blood pressure reading">Blood pressure reading</h3>
        <p>A blood pressure reading is made up of 2 measurements, systolic pressure and diastolic pressure. This is commonly written as [systolic] / [diastolic] (eg 120/80)</p>
        <p>
          Blood pressure is classed as controlled when a systolic reading is below 140 <b>AND</b> the
          diastolic reading is below 90. The <b>AND</b> is important, both statements must be for blood pressure control
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Controlled</b>: BP reading where systolic &lt;140
          <b>AND</b> diastolic &lt;90
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Uncontrolled</b>: BP reading where systolic &ge;140
          <b>OR</b> diastolic &ge;90
        </p>
        <h3 id="numerators-and-denominators">Numerators and denominators</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Numerators</b> and <b>denominators</b> are common descriptors in
          epidemiology and will be used throught this document and the
          dashboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <b>denominator</b> indicates to pool of patients being explored
          while the <b>numerator</b> is a subset of the denominator.
        </p>
        <p>Eg. [numerator] / [deonminator] - where 150 / 200 is 75%</p>
        <h2 id="patient">Patient</h2>
